% /USR/PEOPLE/KOAY/CODE/PRINCETON-ECS/MEX/+CV/BARYCENTRICMESHWARP.MEXA64    Very fast warping with locally linear assumptions.
%
%  Usage syntax:
%    interpolated = cv.barycentricMeshWarp(source, xSample, ySample, xTarget, yTarget);
%
%  *Sample should be locations in pixel units of the original measurements.
%  *Target are the locations in pixel units to which the original image should be warped,
%  specified as a function of time.
